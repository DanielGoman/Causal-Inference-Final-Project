# Causal-Inference-Final-Project

A work done by Lior Danino and Daniel Goman

A project in the course of Causal Inference

In our work we explore a dataset consisting of people in the US who were killed by policemen. 

While on scene where a suspect was killed, the policeman who killed the suspect could either wear a body camera or not.

Suspects could be killed either by being shot, or by being first tasered and then shot.

Our goal is to evaluate the true causal effect of a policeman wearing a body camera on the manner of death of suspects who are apprehended by that policeman.

In this work we first naively evaluate the ATE for reference. Then we proceed to employing several methods we have seen throughout the course in order to evaluate the ATE.

We come to the conclusion that there is no causal effect of wearing a body camera on the manner of death of suspects.
